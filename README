This is the SB ticket system

The idea of the ticket system is as follows

1. The front page of some portal we host receive a request from a user to view a page containing protected content.
2. They take the content id and the user attributes and the user ip and send it to this system
3. this system sends the content id and the user attributes onwards to the authorizer
4. The authorizer returns the content IDs that was allowed
5. This system then makes a ticket for these content ids, and store it in a memcache.
6. The ticket id is returnted to the portal.
7. The portal embeds the ticket id in the url to the user

When the user will then fetch the content, the following happens

1. The content server reads the ticket id from the URL
2. The content server sends a request to this system
3. This system returns the full ticket
4. The content server checks if the ticket allows access to the content id the user requested

This system, as can be read, is a webservice acting as a frontend to a memcached instance. The webservice
is just a war file, that should be put in any tomcat instance. The webservice is configured with context xml, an example
of which can be found in META-INF in the war file.
